- the original implementation had all the books' info hardcoded in the index.html file which is less than ideal. instead we want to store all the books in a db (or pretend to ;)
- card styling on the last card on medium screen made it longer at the bottom than the others
- add increasing the knowledge of the internet to the main page
- I added security to the payment intents endpoint buy only passing in the product instead of the price
- I went to the dashboard and added afterpay as a payment option
- change the checkout page to have uri encoded productIds and quantities instead of just a single productId
- search products api will take an object that you can search more fields on
- used stack overflow for the stripe animation
- there's a potential bug in the stripe docs, I don't think you can import server code to a page (success page)
- to extend instead of linking to a payment failed page I could just redirect to the checkout page again (and use a query param for payment failed status?)
- I need to add idempotency key to payment
- need to make sure i update the favicon


IMPROVEMENTS
- add caching to APIs
